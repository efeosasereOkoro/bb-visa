# Barbados Visa and Immigration Service (BB-Visa)

**Live Prototype:** [https://efeosasereOkoro.github.io/bb-visa/](https://efeosasereOkoro.github.io/bb-visa/ )

A prototype digital government service for the Barbados Immigration Department. This application streamlines the application process for multiple immigration pathways using a modern, accessible interface based on Digital Government (GDS) design principles.

## Features

- **Multi-Pathway Routing**: Dynamic form flow based on journey selection (Passport, Work Permit, Citizenship, Residency, or Study).
- **One-Thing-Per-Page Design**: Minimizes cognitive load by presenting one logical block of information at a time.
- **Dynamic Eligibility Logic**: Validates age, citizenship, and specific subtypes (e.g., C2 vs C3 Work Permits) before allowing progression.
- **Repeatable Data Entry**: Supports adding multiple dependants and full residence history tracking.
- **Prototype Payment Simulator**: Simulates the EZPay+ government payment gateway integration.
- **Document Evidence Tracking**: Context-aware upload checklists based on the selected application type.

## Pathways Supported

1.  **Immigration Passport**: Full application flow for adults and children.
2.  **Work Permit**: Supports Long-term (C2) and Short-term (C3) applications.
3.  **Citizenship**: Handles claims via Descent, Marriage, and Registration.
4.  **Reside Permanently**: Pathway for permanent residency including residence history tracking.
5.  **Study**: H-1 Certificate of Eligibility lookup and H-2 application linking.

## Tech Stack
